This directory contains multisequence alignments of coding sequences
(CDS). The alignments are global alignments generated semiautomatically
from blast searched. The blast results are realigned with mafft/linsi. If
possible ends are filled before realigning. The aligments are not perfect
and partial sequences eventually show an artefact typical for linsi,
which moves the terminal base of a partial sequence to the end of the
whole alignment.

The alignments are suited for viewing with clustalx-1.83.
